# Rename UPM Package
An action that will edit and rename files to reflect a name change in your [custom upm package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomPackages.html). Changing the name of a upm package can be tedious and this action can automate editting the package.json and .asmdef files to match your package's new name.

**This action will edit:**
- Edit the name and display name entries in 'package.json' file
- Edit .asmdef files
